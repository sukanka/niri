### Overview

Niri has several options that are only useful for debugging, or are experimental and have known issues.
They are not meant for normal use.

> [!CAUTION]
> These options are **not** covered by the [config breaking change policy](./Configuration:-Introduction.md#breaking-change-policy).
> They can change or stop working at any point with little notice.

Here are all the options at a glance:

```kdl

    preview-render "screencast"
    // preview-render "screen-capture"
    enable-overlay-planes

    Mod+Shift+Ctrl+O { debug-toggle-opaque-regions; }
    Mod+Shift+Ctrl+D { debug-toggle-damage; }
}
```

### `preview-render`

Make niri render the monitors the same way as for a screencast or a screen capture.

Useful for previewing the `block-out-from` window rule.

```kdl
debug {
    preview-render "screencast"
    // preview-render "screen-capture"
}
```

### `enable-overlay-planes`

Enable direct scanout into overlay planes.
May cause frame drops during some animations on some hardware (which is why it is not the default).

Direct scanout into the primary plane is always enabled.

```kdl
debug {
    enable-overlay-planes
}
```

### `disable-cursor-plane`

Disable the use of the cursor plane.
The cursor will be rendered together with the rest of the frame.

Useful to work around driver bugs on specific hardware.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-cursor-plane
}
```

### `disable-cursor-plane-on-hdr`

Composite the cursor on the primary plane instead of using the cursor plane on outputs composited in an HDR blend space.

By default niri uses the cursor plane on HDR outputs too.
The plane bypasses the renderer, so its contents get a LUT-accelerated CPU sRGB-to-PQ encode on every cursor image change, and cursors whose content isn't plain SDR still fall back to compositing.
Keeping the cursor on its plane also keeps direct scanout of fullscreen content working while the cursor is visible: a composited cursor is an extra element on top of the fullscreen surface, which forces the whole frame through the renderer.

The encode still runs on the main thread once per cursor image change.
No performance issues were observed on AMD even with frequently-changing cursors, but AMD also has a smaller cursor plane size limit; on Nvidia, whose cursor planes can be larger, it may be worth setting this flag if you notice stutter with rapidly animating cursors.

Overridden by `disable-cursor-plane`, which disables the cursor plane everywhere.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-cursor-plane-on-hdr
}
```

### `scanout-post-blend-encode`

On HDR outputs, let a fullscreen surface go direct scanout even when the display's plane color pipelines can't apply the final PQ encode, by moving that encode behind blending onto the CRTC gamma LUT.

This is aimed at Nvidia, whose plane color pipelines can decode, scale and gamut-convert content but always end in linear light, so SDR or non-BT.2020 content on an HDR output is otherwise always composited.
With this flag, when a single surface covers the whole output and nothing else is visible, the plane is programmed to output linear light normalized to the display's peak luminance, and the CRTC gamma LUT encodes it to PQ in the same atomic commit.
A cursor on the cursor plane doesn't prevent this: on those frames its image is converted to the same linear light instead of PQ, so the gamma LUT encodes it along with the surface (cursor images in both forms are cached, so moving in and out of the offload doesn't re-convert them).
A composited cursor does prevent direct scanout, so don't combine this with `disable-cursor-plane` or `disable-cursor-plane-on-hdr`.

This is experimental.
The gamma LUT is indexed by linear light, so it has little precision near black and dark gradients may band.
While it is active, gamma adjustments from gamma-control clients (night light tools) are deferred until the offload is disabled again.

```kdl
debug {
    scanout-post-blend-encode
}
```

### `disable-direct-scanout`

Disable direct scanout to both the primary plane and the overlay planes.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-direct-scanout
}
```

### `restrict-primary-scanout-to-matching-format`

Restricts direct scanout to the primary plane to when the window buffer exactly matches the composition swapchain format.

This flag may prevent unexpected bandwidth changes when going between composition and scanout.
The plan is to make it default in the future, when we implement a way to tell the clients the composition swapchain format.
As is, it may prevent some clients (mpv on my machine) from scanning out to the primary plane.

```kdl
debug {
    restrict-primary-scanout-to-matching-format
}
```

### `force-disable-connectors-on-resume`

<sup>Since: 26.04</sup>

Force-disables all outputs upon resuming niri (TTY switch or waking up from suspend).
This causes a modeset/screen blank on all outputs.

If niri rendering is corrupted, or monitors don't light up after a TTY switch, you can try this flag.

```kdl
debug {
    force-disable-connectors-on-resume
}
```

### `render-drm-device`

Override niri's primary rendering DRM device.

You can set this to make niri use a different primary GPU than the default one.
Normally, all outputs are composited on this GPU.
With [`render-on-output-device`](#render-on-output-device), each output is composited on its own GPU, while the primary GPU remains the default for clients and the fallback for outputs without a render node.

```kdl
debug {
    render-drm-device "/dev/dri/renderD129"
}
```

### `render-on-output-device`

Composite each output on the GPU that drives it, instead of compositing all outputs on the primary GPU.
Outputs whose DRM device has no usable render node fall back to the primary GPU.
This option is disabled by default and requires restarting niri to take effect.

This is useful on hybrid GPU laptops with the internal panel connected to the integrated GPU and an external gaming monitor connected to the discrete GPU.
If applications render on the GPU driving their output, their normal display path can avoid cross-GPU copies, including when a fullscreen game needs compositing instead of direct scanout.
Fullscreen alone does not guarantee direct scanout.

The option controls niri's compositor, not which GPU an application uses.
For integrated-GPU desktop applications and discrete-GPU games, keep the integrated GPU as the primary GPU (or select it with [`render-drm-device`](#render-drm-device)) and launch games with the appropriate GPU selection settings.
Moving a window to an output on another GPU does not force the application to switch GPUs, so cross-GPU copies may still be necessary for that window.
Screen capture and other offscreen rendering may also require cross-GPU transfers.
PipeWire captures can use DMA-BUF buffers allocated on their target output's GPU, including window captures and dynamic targets.
When a target moves to another GPU, niri waits for outstanding writes, retires the old DMA-BUF buffers through a shared-memory negotiation, and offers buffers from the new GPU.
Shared-memory capture remains available when local DMA-BUF allocation or import is unsupported, or the consumer prefers it.

```kdl
debug {
    render-on-output-device
    // Optional: select the integrated GPU as the primary GPU.
    // Use your integrated GPU's actual render-node path.
    // render-drm-device "/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:07:00.0-render"
}
```

### `ignore-drm-device`

<sup>Since: 25.11</sup>

List DRM devices that niri will ignore.
Useful for GPU passthrough when you don't want niri to open a certain device.

```kdl
debug {
    ignore-drm-device "/dev/dri/renderD128"
    ignore-drm-device "/dev/dri/renderD130"
}
```

### `force-pipewire-invalid-modifier`

<sup>Since: 25.01</sup>

Forces PipeWire screencasting to use the invalid modifier, even when DRM offers more modifiers.

Useful for testing the invalid modifier code path that is hit by drivers that don't support modifiers.

```kdl
debug {
    force-pipewire-invalid-modifier
}
```

### `disable-pipewire-dmabuf`

<sup>Since: next release</sup>

Disable DMA-BUF sharing for PipeWire screencasts, forcing shared-memory buffers instead.

Useful for testing shm screencasting.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-pipewire-dmabuf
}
```

### `dbus-interfaces-in-non-session-instances`

Make niri create its D-Bus interfaces even if it's not running as a `--session`.

Useful for testing screencasting changes without having to relogin.

<sup>Since: next release</sup>
The main niri instance will automatically take back the interfaces once the new instance quits.

```kdl
debug {
    dbus-interfaces-in-non-session-instances
}
```

### `wait-for-frame-completion-before-queueing`

Wait until every frame is done rendering before handing it over to DRM.

Useful for diagnosing certain synchronization and performance problems.

```kdl
debug {
    wait-for-frame-completion-before-queueing
}
```

### `emulate-zero-presentation-time`

Emulate zero (unknown) presentation time returned from DRM.

This is a thing on NVIDIA proprietary drivers, so this flag can be used to test that niri doesn't break too hard on those systems.

```kdl
debug {
    emulate-zero-presentation-time
}
```

### `disable-resize-throttling`

<sup>Since: 0.1.9</sup>

Disable throttling resize events sent to windows.

By default, when resizing quickly (e.g. interactively), a window will only receive the next size once it has made a commit for the previously requested size.
This is required for resize transactions to work properly, and it also helps certain clients which don't batch incoming resizes from the compositor.

Disabling resize throttling will send resizes to windows as fast as possible, which is potentially very fast (for example, on a 1000 Hz mouse).

```kdl
debug {
    disable-resize-throttling
}
```

### `disable-transactions`

<sup>Since: 0.1.9</sup>

Disable transactions (resize and close).

By default, windows which must resize together, do resize together.
For example, all windows in a column must resize at the same time to maintain the combined column height equal to the screen height, and to maintain the same window width.

Transactions make niri wait until all windows finish resizing before showing them all on screen in one, synchronized frame.
For them to work properly, resize throttling shouldn't be disabled (with the previous debug flag).

```kdl
debug {
    disable-transactions
}
```

### `keep-laptop-panel-on-when-lid-is-closed`

<sup>Since: 0.1.10</sup>

By default, niri will disable the internal laptop monitor when the laptop lid is closed.
This flag turns off this behavior and will leave the internal laptop monitor on.

```kdl
debug {
    keep-laptop-panel-on-when-lid-is-closed
}
```

### `disable-monitor-names`

<sup>Since: 0.1.10</sup>

Disables the make/model/serial monitor names, as if niri fails to read them from the EDID.

Use this flag to work around a crash present in 0.1.9 and 0.1.10 when connecting two monitors with matching make/model/serial.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-monitor-names
}
```

### `strict-new-window-focus-policy`

<sup>Since: 25.01</sup>

Disables heuristic automatic focusing for new windows.
Only windows that activate themselves with a valid xdg-activation token will be focused.

```kdl
debug {
    strict-new-window-focus-policy
}
```

### `honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial`

<sup>Since: 25.05</sup>

Widely-used clients such as Discord and Telegram make fresh xdg-activation tokens upon clicking on their tray icon or on their notification.
Most of the time, these fresh tokens will have invalid serials, because the app needs to be focused to get a valid serial, and if the user clicks on a tray icon or a notification, it is usually because the app *isn't* focused, and the user wants to focus it.

By default, niri ignores xdg-activation tokens with invalid serials, to prevent windows from randomly stealing focus.
This debug flag makes niri honor such tokens, making the aforementioned widely-used apps get focus when clicking on their tray icon or notification.

Use the [`on-xdg-activate` window rule](./Configuration:-Window-Rules.md#on-xdg-activate) to control what niri does for individual windows when it accepts an xdg-activation request.

Amusingly, clicking on a notification sends the app a perfectly valid activation token from the notification daemon, but these apps seem to simply ignore it.
Maybe in the future these apps/toolkits (Electron, Qt) are fixed, making this debug flag unnecessary.

```kdl
debug {
    honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial
}
```

### `skip-cursor-only-updates-during-vrr`

<sup>Since: 25.08</sup>

Briefly suppresses cursor-only updates while variable refresh rate is active and new content frames are being presented.

Useful for games where the cursor isn't drawn internally to prevent erratic VRR shifts in response to cursor movement.

If no new frame has been presented for 50 ms, niri allows cursor-only updates again.
A one-shot timer retries the last suppressed update even if the pointer stops moving, so an idle application does not leave the cursor frozen.

```kdl
debug {
    skip-cursor-only-updates-during-vrr
}
```

### `deactivate-unfocused-windows`

<sup>Since: 25.08</sup>

Some clients (notably, Chromium- and Electron-based, like Teams or Slack) erroneously use the Activated xdg window state instead of keyboard focus for things like deciding whether to send notifications for new messages, or for picking where to show an IME popup.
Niri keeps the Activated state on unfocused workspaces and invisible tabbed windows (to reduce unwanted animations), surfacing bugs in these applications.

Set this debug flag to work around these problems.
It will cause niri to drop the Activated state for all unfocused windows.

```kdl
debug {
    deactivate-unfocused-windows
}
```

### `disable-10bit-output`

<sup>Since: next release</sup>

By default, niri will try to output a 10-bit color format to the monitor (before falling back to 8-bit).
However, this can currently cause problems on some Intel + NVIDIA mixed-GPU setups: the screen doesn't light up, or displays only white, etc.

Until this is fixed in Smithay, you can disable 10-bit color formats by setting this debug flag.

In this tree, 10-bit formats are only attempted on outputs with HDR enabled; SDR outputs always use 8-bit.
On HDR outputs, this flag keeps an 8-bit framebuffer while still sending the HDR signalling.

```kdl
debug {
    disable-10bit-output
}
```

### `force-tearing`

Enables screen tearing unconditionally, overriding any [`allow-tearing`](./Configuration:-Window-Rules.md#allow-tearing) window rules and the [output `allow-tearing`](./Configuration:-Outputs.md#allow-tearing) setting.

```kdl
debug {
    force-tearing
}
```

### `vulkan-renderer`

Renders using Vulkan instead of OpenGL ES on the TTY backend.

This is experimental, but feature-complete: custom-shader effects (borders, shadows, rounded corners, blur, xray backgrounds, window animations, custom animation shaders, HDR tone mapping) all render on the Vulkan renderer. wl_drm (legacy EGL buffer sharing) is unavailable; clients use dmabuf.

```kdl
debug {
    vulkan-renderer
}
```

### Key Bindings

These are not debug options, but rather key bindings.

#### `toggle-debug-tint`

Tints all surfaces green, unless they are being directly scanned out.

Useful to check if direct scanout is working.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+Ctrl+T { toggle-debug-tint; }
}
```

#### `debug-toggle-opaque-regions`

<sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>

Tints regions marked as opaque with blue and the rest of the render elements with red.

Useful to check how Wayland surfaces and internal render elements mark their parts as opaque, which is a rendering performance optimization.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+Ctrl+O { debug-toggle-opaque-regions; }
}
```

#### `debug-toggle-damage`

<sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>

Tints damaged regions with red.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+Ctrl+D { debug-toggle-damage; }
}
```
